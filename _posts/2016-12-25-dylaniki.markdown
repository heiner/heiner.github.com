Ahh... dylanchords.com. A long time ago, when the internet was in its
puberty and I just ridded myself of >>Music<< as a subject in school,
you were there for me. A website in the style of the times, which
filled my youthful admiration of Dylan with an actual, achievable,
purpose: To teach myself to play the guitar (after a fashion). I
scanned those songs for the [evil F
chord](http://dylanchords.info/roadmaps.htm#fingering) and other
cryptic nastiness (Bm7-5?!), printed out and tried to recreate one
after another (after a fashion). Soon enough I tuned
my borrowed guitar in Open D tuning and played a heartfelt
_Buckets of Rain_. I felt sad but proud, the family went from
amused to annoyed, and my guitar skills from pre-beginner to amateur.

The guitar, Dylan, and dylanchords.com would stay with the through
university. Printing out old-style HTML would take a detour through an
arguably more [old-styled system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX),
and that mere process helped convince a number of people that I had
sufficient interest in >>culture<< to be worth their time. Today,
the [resulting](http://kuettler.org/seal/) >>project<< is dormant, and
made obsolete by more [recent](http://www.apple.com/iphone/)
[technology](https://madeby.google.com/phone/).

And yet, dylanchords stayed with me. The .com domain name effectively
moved to another one for reasons that don't seem to matter so much
now, and these days, picking up an instrument isn't something I do
daily anymore. Or even weekly. But dylanchords still seems to
matter. Recently, even the choice of subject has [arguably been
vindicated](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/dylan-facts.html).

It being Christmas today, it feels right to thank the creator. No, not
that one. Eyolf Ã˜strem has >>tabbed<< around 900 songs, with patience
and skill that others couldn't even think of displaying, to not even
mention giving away all this work for free. *Thank you*, Eyolf
Chordmaster. We don't always
[agree](http://oestrem.com/thingstwice/2010/06/neighbourhood-bully-indeed/). It
doesn't matter. Thanks for your work. It inspired me, I'm sure it
inspired many others.

Merry Christmas.

For further convenience, I've started hosting a jekyll-generated,
mobile-enabled version of Eyolf's chordwork at
[dylaniki.org](http://dylaniki.org) ([code at
github](https://github.com/heiner/dylaniki/tree/gh-pages)). I find it
useful for looking up songs from the phone, and maybe others feel the same.
